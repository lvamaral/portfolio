      <h2># Work Experience</h2>
      <h3>Platform Engineer at Lob</h3>
      <p><i>San Francisco, January 2018-Present</i></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Led a group of four engineers and worked cross-functionally with other internal teams to implement a major new product
        offering that allows customers to programmatically send branded envelopes with their mail.
        In less than 5 months, the feature has seen close to 20 million envelope orders and resulted in over $400K in revenue
        for the company. Technical work included a client-facing AngularJS dashboard page, an internal React + Redux dashboard,
        and a backend inventory tracking system built on Node, Redis, and PostregreSQL</li>
        <li>Led the project to implement the basis of the company’s revenue tracking system by generating daily SQL views
        aggregating and standardizing millions of rows of usage data from AWS Redshift into a simpler format non technical team
        members use to build financial dashboards. This decreased the time it takes to generate the company’s usage revenue from
        a month to a single day</li>
        <li>Designed and implemented the company’s data deletion system, which ensures the company is GDPR compliant by allowing
        customers to request a deletion of their data on certain schedules. It was built using serverless AWS Lambdas and Step
        Functions triggered periodically to efficiently redact hundreds of thousands of rows of data from multiple sources</li>
        <li>Developed a custom client-side method to extract a written signature from a picture that was a finalist in the company’s
        yearly Hackathon competition for innovative ideas; proactively productized the concept into a feature that has been used
        hundreds of times in the company’s Custom Checks product</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>Associate at Expanding Capital, Venture Capital Firm</h3>
      <p><i>San Francisco, May 2016 – Mar 2017</i></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Created a Python web-crawler to aggregate information on startup funding rounds, and used statistical methodology to find quantitative indicators of startup investment attractiveness based on previous funding activity</li>
        <li>Prospected and wrote research briefs for potential investments, ultimately producing a list of 60+ “wish-list” companies the firm’s partners pursued, resulting in two $1MM investments</li>
        <li>Designed and launched the official company website using HTML and CSS </li>
      </ul>
